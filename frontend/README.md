### Setting up environment
To run this demo you must serve it from a server rather than the file system.
This demo requires webpack to build and run. To install webpack (and other dependencies) run:

> npm install

To run the demo, install and run Live Server:

> npm install -g live-server

Live Server will automatically open a new browser tab at http://localhost:8080 to show the demo folder.

### Or Enter URL into web browser manually:

http://<ip address>:8080
ie;
http://127.0.0.1:8080
